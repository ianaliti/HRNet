# HRnet React Conversion Project

## üíº Project Overview

**HRnet** is an internal web application used to manage employee records for **WealthHealth**, a major financial company. The current implementation relies on jQuery for the front-end, which has led to bugs and performance issues. The goal is to **convert HRnet from jQuery to React** to improve performance and stability.

In this project, we will focus on converting individual components of the HRnet application into React, starting with **DatePicker**, **Modal**, **Dropdown**, and **Table** components, which have been identified as problematic due to their reliance on slow jQuery plugins.

## üîß Key Components

### 1. **DatePickerForm**
The `DatePickerForm` component handles the selection of **Date of Birth** and **Start Date** using MUI's DatePicker component.
### 2. **AddressForm**
The AddressForm component handles input fields for **Street, City, State,** and **Zip Code**. It validates the fields based on the requirements and stores them in the form's state.
### 3. **DepartmentSelect**
The DepartmentSelect component is a dropdown that allows users to select an employee's **Department**. It uses validation to ensure the selection is made.
### 4. **DepartmentSelect**
The **Modal** component is used to display a confirmation or success message after an employee has been successfully added.

## Conclusion
This project aims to convert an outdated jQuery-based HRnet application into a modern, React-based solution. By replacing slow jQuery plugins with custom React components, we aim to improve the application's speed, usability, and maintainability.
